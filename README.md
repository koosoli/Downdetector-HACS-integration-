## Sensors

Each configured service creates a sensor with the following:

### Status Values
- **operational**: Service is running normally (üü¢)
- **minor_outage**: Service is experiencing issues (üü°)

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify when service is down"

      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.facebook_status
        attribute: status
        to: "major_outage"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Service Outage Alert"
          message: "Facebook is experiencing a major outage!"
```
